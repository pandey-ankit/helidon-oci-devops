# Modify the Helidon application for Object storage integration 

## Introduction

The objective of this lab is to demonstrate how to add Object Storage access from the Helidon application. This is done by replacing a variable which is used to store the greeting word with an object that will now become the new greeting word container and is stored and retrieved from an Object Storage bucket. Since the object is persisted, the last greeting word value will survive application restarts. Without this change and with greeting word in memory via the variable, the greeting word will reset to default value when the application is restarted.

Estimated time: 15 minutes
